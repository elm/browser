    )

{-| This module allows you to manipulate the DOM in various ways. It covers:

  - Focus and blur input elements.
  - Get the `width` and `height` of elements.
  - Get the `x` and `y` coordinates of elements.
  - Figure out the scroll position.
  - Change the scroll position!

We use different terminology than JavaScript though...


# Terminology

Have you ever thought about how &ldquo;scrolling&rdquo; is a metaphor about
scrolls? Like hanging scrolls of caligraphy made during the Han Dynasty
in China?

This metaphor falls apart almost immediately though. For example, many scrolls
read horizontally! Like a [Sefer Torah][torah] or [Chinese Handscrolls][hand].
The two sides move independently, sometimes kept in place with stones. What is
a scroll bar in this world? And [hanging scrolls][hang] (which _are_ displayed
vertically) do not &ldquo;scroll&rdquo; at all! They hang!

So in JavaScript, we start with a badly stretched metaphor and add a bunch of
DOM details like padding, borders, and margins. How do those relate to scrolls?
For example, JavaScript has `clientWidth`. Client like a feudal state that pays
tribute to the emperor? And `offsetHeight`. Can an offset even have height? And
what has that got to do with scrolls?

So instead of inheriting this metaphorical hodge-podge, we use terminology from
3D graphics. You have a **scene** containing all your elements and a **viewport**
into the scene. I think it ends up being a lot clearer, but you can evaluate
for yourself when you see the diagrams later!

**Note:** For more scroll facts, I recommend [A Day on the Grand Canal with
the Emperor of China or: Surface Is Illusion But So Is Depth][doc] where David
Hockney explores the history of _perspective_ in art. Really interesting!

-- FOCUS


{-| Find a DOM node by `id` and focus on it. So if you wanted to focus a node
like `<input type="text" id="search-box">` you could say:

    import Browser.Dom as Dom
    import Task

    type Msg
        = NoOp

    focusSearchBox : Cmd Msg
    focusSearchBox =
        Task.attempt (\_ -> NoOp) (Dom.focus "search-box")

Notice that this code ignores the possibility that `search-box` is not used
as an `id` by any node, failing silently in that case. It would be better to
log the failure with whatever error reporting system you use.

-}
focus : String -> Task Error ()
focus =
    Elm.Kernel.Browser.call "focus"


{-| Find a DOM node by `id` and make it lose focus. So if you wanted a node
like `<input type="text" id="search-box">` to lose focus you could say:

    import Browser.Dom as Dom
    import Task

    type Msg
        = NoOp

    unfocusSearchBox : Cmd Msg
    unfocusSearchBox =
        Task.attempt (\_ -> NoOp) (Dom.blur "search-box")

Notice that this code ignores the possibility that `search-box` is not used
as an `id` by any node, failing silently in that case. It would be better to
log the failure with whatever error reporting system you use.

-}
blur : String -> Task Error ()
blur =
    Elm.Kernel.Browser.call "blur"



-- ERROR


{-| Many functions in this module look up DOM nodes up by their `id`. If you
ask for an `id` that is not in the DOM, you will get this error.
-}
type Error
    = NotFound String



-- VIEWPORT


{-| Get information on the current viewport of the browser.

![getViewport](https://elm.github.io/browser/v1/getViewport.svg)

If you want to move the viewport around (i.e. change the scroll position) you
can use [`setViewport`](#setViewport) which change the `x` and `y` of the
viewport.

-}
getViewport : Task x Viewport
getViewport =
    Elm.Kernel.Browser.withWindow Elm.Kernel.Browser.getViewport


{-| All the information about the current viewport.

![getViewport](https://elm.github.io/browser/v1/getViewport.svg)

-}
type alias Viewport =
    { scene :
        { width : Float
        , height : Float
        }
    , viewport :
        { x : Float
        , y : Float
        , width : Float
        , height : Float
        }
    }


{-| Just like `getViewport`, but for any scrollable DOM node. Say we have an
application with a chat box in the bottom right corner like this:

![chat](https://elm.github.io/browser/v1/chat.svg)

There are probably a whole bunch of messages that are not being shown. You
could scroll up to see them all. Well, we can think of that chat box is a
viewport into a scene!

![getViewportOf](https://elm.github.io/browser/v1/getViewportOf.svg)

This can be useful with [`setViewportOf`](#setViewportOf) to make sure new
messages always appear on the bottom.

The viewport size _does not_ include the border or margins.

**Note:** This data is collected from specific fields in JavaScript, so it
may be helpful to know that:

  - `scene.width` = [`scrollWidth`][sw]
  - `scene.height` = [`scrollHeight`][sh]
  - `viewport.x` = [`scrollLeft`][sl]
  - `viewport.y` = [`scrollTop`][st]
  - `viewport.width` = [`clientWidth`][cw]
  - `viewport.height` = [`clientHeight`][ch]

Neither [`offsetWidth`][ow] nor [`offsetHeight`][oh] are available. The theory
is that (1) the information can always be obtained by using `getElement` on a
node without margins, (2) no cases came to mind where you actually care in the
first place, and (3) it is available through ports if it is really needed.
If you have a case that really needs it though, please share your specific
scenario in an issue! Nicely presented case studies are the raw ingredients for
API improvements!

-}
getViewportOf : String -> Task Error Viewport
getViewportOf =
    Elm.Kernel.Browser.getViewportOf



-- SET VIEWPORT


{-| Change the `x` and `y` offset of the browser viewport immediately. For
example, you could make a command to jump to the top of the page:

    import Browser.Dom as Dom
    import Task

    type Msg
        = NoOp

    resetViewport : Cmd Msg
    resetViewport =
        Task.perform (\_ -> NoOp) (Dom.setViewport 0 0)

This sets the viewport offset to zero.

This could be useful with `Browser.application` where you may want to reset
the viewport when the URL changes. Maybe you go to a &ldquo;new page&rdquo;
and want people to start at the top!

-}
setViewport : Float -> Float -> Task x ()
setViewport =
    Elm.Kernel.Browser.setViewport


{-| Change the `x` and `y` offset of a DOM node&rsquo;s viewport by ID. This
is common in text messaging and chat rooms, where once the messages fill the
screen, you want to always be at the very bottom of the message chain. This
way the latest message is always on screen! You could do this:

    import Browser.Dom as Dom
    import Task

    type Msg
        = NoOp

    jumpToBottom : String -> Cmd Msg
    jumpToBottom id =
        Dom.getViewportOf id
            |> Task.andThen (\info -> Dom.setViewportOf id 0 info.scene.height)
            |> Task.attempt (\_ -> NoOp)

So you could call `jumpToBottom "chat-box"` whenever you add a new message.

**Note 1:** What happens if the viewport is placed out of bounds? Where there
is no `scene` to show? To avoid this question, the `x` and `y` offsets are
clamped such that the viewport is always fully within the `scene`. So when
`jumpToBottom` sets the `y` offset of the viewport to the `height` of the
`scene` (i.e. too far!) it relies on this clamping behavior to put the viewport
back in bounds.

**Note 2:** The example ignores when the element ID is not found, but it would
be great to log that information. It means there may be a bug or a dead link
somewhere!

-}
setViewportOf : String -> Float -> Float -> Task Error ()
setViewportOf =
    Elm.Kernel.Browser.setViewportOf



{--SLIDE VIEWPORT


{-| Change the `x` and `y` offset of the viewport with an animation. In JS,
this corresponds to setting [`scroll-behavior`][sb] to `smooth`.

This can definitely be overused, so try to use it specifically when you want
the user to be spatially situated in a scene. For example, a &ldquo;back to
top&rdquo; button might use it:

    import Browser.Dom as Dom
    import Task

    type Msg = NoOp

    backToTop : Cmd Msg
    backToTop =
      Task.perform (\_ -> NoOp) (Dom.slideViewport 0 0)

Be careful when paring this with `Browser.application`. When the URL changes
and a whole new scene is going to be rendered, using `setViewport` is probably
best. If you are moving within a scene, you may benefit from a mix of
`setViewport` and `slideViewport`. Sliding to the top is nice, but sliding
around everywhere is probably annoying.

--}
-- ELEMENT


{-| Get position information about specific elements. Say we put
`id "jesting-aside"` on the seventh paragraph of the text. When we call
`getElement "jesting-aside"` we would get the following information:

![getElement](https://elm.github.io/browser/v1/getElement.svg)

This can be useful for:

  - **Scrolling** &mdash; Pair this information with `setViewport` to scroll
    specific elements into view. This gives you a lot of control over where exactly
    the element would be after the viewport moved.

  - **Drag and Drop** &mdash; As of this writing, `touchmove` events do not tell
    you which element you are currently above. To figure out if you have dragged
    something over the target, you could see if the `pageX` and `pageY` of the
    touch are inside the `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` of the target element.

**Note:** This corresponds to JavaScript&rsquo;s [`getBoundingClientRect`][gbcr],
so **the element&rsquo;s margins are included in its `width` and `height`**.
With scrolling, maybe you want to include the margins. With drag-and-drop, you
probably do not, so some folks set the margins to zero and put the target
element in a `<div>` that adds the spacing. Just something to be aware of!

[gbcr]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect

-}
getElement : String -> Task Error Element
getElement =
    Elm.Kernel.Browser.getElement


{-| A bunch of information about the position and size of an element relative
to the overall scene.

![getElement](https://elm.github.io/browser/v1/getElement.svg)

-}
type alias Element =
    { scene :
        { width : Float
        , height : Float
        }
    , viewport :
        { x : Float
        , y : Float
        , width : Float
        , height : Float
        }
    , element :
        { x : Float
        , y : Float
        , width : Float
        , height : Float
        }
    }
